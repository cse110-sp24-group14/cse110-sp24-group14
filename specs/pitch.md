## Statement of Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a multipurpose coding journal that can be used to keep track of items and also be tailored to specifically help students who code. Our product aims to assist with task-tracking for students while also having nice quality of life features to help people who code.

## Comptition/Existing Products

We decided to look for products that were used for task tracking and that also maybe included developer-specific features. Some of the products we found included:
- Notion (Code book)
- My No-Code Journal
- Julia Evans blog  on a dev journal

## Audience

We were deciding between three different audiences: students who code, hobbyist developers, and enterprise customers. We decided to go with students who code because we know the audience and needs of the audience the best.

We wanted our project to include features that helped with task tracking and also were specific to developers. Some of the features we want to include in MVP include:
- Reward system to get tasks done
- Calendar
- Daily task list
- Code block integration (no syntax highlighting)
- Light mode appearance
- Dashboard

Some features we brainstorted for V1 after MVP inlude:
- Dark mode
- Tag system
- Timeline
- Markdown converter

## Sketch

Here is a very preliminary sketch of our project interface. Our designer is still working on more detailed sketches which will be shown during the TA standup.

## Risks/Rabbit Holes

Some of the risks and rabbit holes that we brainstormed included:
- Deviating too much from original scope/adding too much scope
