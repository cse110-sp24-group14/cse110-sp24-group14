# Whether to include markdown editor 

## Context and Problem Statement

A lot of devopers utilize markdown, so a markdown editor may be helpful in the application

## Considered Options

* Add markdown editor
* Add limited markdown editor
* Do not add markdown editor

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We decided to not add a markdown editor to MVP and to move it to V1 so that it is still in on the roadmap but is not a priority. We only plan on doing it if we have time.
