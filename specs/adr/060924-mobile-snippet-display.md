# Snippet Display on Mobile Devices

## Context and Problem Statement

When a user opens our application on a mobile interface, we are tasked with deciding which features to include or not. Among these features is the code snippet.
We anticipate that when on a mobile interface, the tasks will be the primary feature of the developer journal that the user will be interested in.

## Considered Options

* One option considered displaying existing snippets in a smaller container for mobile users.

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen option: we decided to remove the snippet feature from mobile devices, as we expect our target users to access the app via mobile exclusively for viewing tasks and related features.
