# SQL Libraries For Testing

## Context and Problem Statement

As we have an SQL database, developers want to be able to unit-test the SQL queries they have made in a controlled environment.  

## Considered Options

* MySQL2
* SQLite3

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We decided to use SQLite3 as it had the ability to create local SQL databases in memory. It reduced file bloat as we didn't need to create a new file for the database and allowed for a consistent yet easily changeable database. MySQL2 could not create local databases without starting our docker container and creating a file.
