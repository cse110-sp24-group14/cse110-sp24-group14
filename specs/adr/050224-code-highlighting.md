# Code blocks 
 
## Context and Problem Statement

Developers would appreciate having code blocks. We need to figure out the scope for this feature.

## Considered Options

* No code blocks because too hard
* Code block with limited functionality 
* Code block with full functionality

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Code block with limited functionality because syntax highlighting is too hard/time consuming without a use of an external library.
