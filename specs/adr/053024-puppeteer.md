# Puppeteer

## Context and Problem Statement

Developers need to test the interface and make sure the elements and content displayed are correct.

## Considered Options

* Manual testing by visual verification
* Automated testing using JS Framework, Puppeteer

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We decided to use Puppeteer to aid us with end to end testing. We found that, although manual testing is easy, it has a lot of room for error. Automated testing allows us to easily idenfity errors accurately.
