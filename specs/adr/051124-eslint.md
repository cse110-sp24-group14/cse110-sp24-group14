# What ESLint config to use
 
## Context and Problem Statement

There are various formatting options that ESLint abides by.

## Considered Options

* Standard
* Google
* Airbnb
* Other

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Standard becuase none of us are experienced enough to know the upsides from options so we are just going with default.
