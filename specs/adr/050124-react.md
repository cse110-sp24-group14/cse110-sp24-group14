# Whether to use React or not

## Context and Problem Statement

We were given the opportunity to use React for our project if we could justify how it could help us.

## Considered Options

* Vanilla JS
* React

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We decided to stick with Vanilla JS since some people were learnign web dev for the first time and also the class uses Vanilla JS. We thought that this outweighed the benefit of compoenent based design.
