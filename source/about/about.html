            Hi! We are a group of students at UCSD in CSE 110 with Professor Powell.  Weâ€™re a diverse team, working together to create a coding journal site for programing students by programming students. Many of us have varying degrees of expertise in a wide range of topics and skills, making it possible for us to work with a wide set of ideas to deliver a useful product for many.
